# Changelog

## 4.6.1

Local-build fix for the HA add-on + doorbell dashboard card.

- **Fix add-on install (404):** the stable add-on pulled a prebuilt
  `ghcr.io/idisposable/...-homeassistant:<version>` image that didn't
  exist and wouldn't contain this fork's code. Removed `image:` and
  added `build.yaml`; the Dockerfile now compiles this fork's source
  (go2rtc + wyze-bridge + gwell-proxy) locally, so the add-on runs
  THIS repo's code.
- **Doorbell/motion events exposed in the add-on UI:** new `events`
  config section (`motion_api`, `recent_window`) mapped to
  `MOTION_API` / `EVENT_RECENT_WINDOW`.
- **Doorbell dashboard card:** the auto-generated Lovelace dashboard
  (`/dashboard.yaml`) now gives doorbell cameras a button-press
  entity on the picture-glance plus a dedicated "Last Ring / Live
  View" card. Ready-to-paste snippets added to DOCS.
- **Stable entity_id:** the button `event` entity now sets `object_id`
  so HA derives `event.wyze_<mac>_button` deterministically.
- DOCS.md documents the Doorbell Button-Press & Motion Events section.

## 4.6.0

**go2rtc customization** — three long-standing issues that all
wanted a piece of the same knob: give the operator control over
go2rtc's ports, its API auth, and the stream set it serves.

- **Basic auth on go2rtc's `/api/*`** ([#123](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/123)):
	set `GO2RTC_API_USERNAME` + `GO2RTC_API_PASSWORD` and the
	bridge configures go2rtc's `api.username/password`, forwards
	Basic auth on every internal API call, and proxies the same
	credentials through the WebUI's HLS + WebSocket paths so
	browsers don't see a login prompt.
- **Port overrides** ([#108](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/108)):
	`GO2RTC_API_PORT` / `GO2RTC_RTSP_PORT` / `GO2RTC_WEBRTC_PORT`
	move go2rtc off `:1984` / `:8554` / `:8889` when something
	else on the host wants them (e.g. Frigate on `:1984`).
- **Extra streams pass-through** ([#106](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/106)):
	`GO2RTC_EXTRA_STREAMS=name=source[,name=source]` registers
	additional streams alongside the Wyze cameras — RTSP, ONVIF,
	`ffmpeg:`, anything go2rtc understands. Camera names always
	win on collision.
- **Verbatim YAML escape hatch**: `GO2RTC_EXTRA_YAML` is appended
	to the managed config after a visible marker for anything the
	typed knobs above don't cover (custom `publish:` / `hass:` /
	ONVIF discovery blocks, etc.).
- HA add-on: new **go2rtc** options section wraps the same
	surface — `api_port`, `api_username`, `api_password`,
	`rtsp_port`, `webrtc_port`, `extra_streams`, `extra_yaml`.

Internal WebUI URL generation (RTSP-copy button, WebRTC copy) now
uses the configured ports instead of hard-coded 8554 / 1984.

**Doorbell button-press (ring) events.** Restores the cloud
event-polling path (dropped in the Go rewrite) and adds explicit
doorbell button-press detection. When a doorbell rings, the bridge
now surfaces it over MQTT, webhooks, and the `/metrics` event log.

- New env var `MOTION_API` (duration, e.g. `1500ms`; `0`/unset
  disables). Enables the `internal/events` poller that calls Wyze's
  `get_event_list`, dedupes by `event_id`, and classifies each event
  as motion or button-press via the event tag/value.
- New env var `EVENT_RECENT_WINDOW` (default `30s`) bounds how old an
  event may be and still be acted on, so a cold start doesn't replay a
  stale backlog.
- MQTT: doorbell cameras (`WYZEDB3`, `HL_DB2`, Doorbell Pro lineage)
  get a Home Assistant **`event` entity** (`event.<cam>_button`,
  `device_class: doorbell`, `event_types: [pressed]`) plus a **device
  trigger** so the ring is selectable in the HA automation UI as
  "<Nickname> — pressed".
- Button-press also fires a `button_press` webhook and records a
  `button_press` entry in the `/metrics` event log; motion events fire
  a `motion` webhook + momentary `…/motion` MQTT topic.
- New package `internal/events` with unit tests for classification,
  dedupe, stale-window filtering, and camera lookup.

## 4.5.0

Runtime **TUTK → WebRTC auto-fallback** for cameras Wyze crippled
via firmware. When a TUTK-path camera fails to stream 5 times in
a row (configurable via `TUTK_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD`), the bridge
promotes it to the WebRTC path for the rest of the process
lifetime — no operator intervention, no config edits, no restart.
Primarily targets `HL_CAM4` (Wyze V4) hit by the early-2025
firmware update but works for any model Wyze exposes over
mars-webcsrv.

- New env var `TUTK_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD` (default `5`, `0` disables).
- Per-camera `forceWebRTC` flag surfaces in `/api/metrics` as
	`protocol_forced: true` and on the metrics page as `webrtc
	(forced)`.
- Auto-promotion fires the issues registry entry
	`camera/fallback/<name>` (warn severity) so the change is
	visible in `/metrics`, `/api/health`, and
	`sensor.wyze_bridge_config_errors`.
- Manual `MODEL_OVERRIDES=HL_CAM4:is_webrtc=true` still works and
	takes precedence — operator intent wins over auto-fallback.
- Full design + testing notes in `DOCS/TUTK_WEBRTC_FALLBACK_DESIGN.md`.
- MIGRATION.md → Known Issues updated to reflect auto-recovery
	is now the default fix path.

## 4.4.2

Reliability + doc pass driven by open issue triage.

- **Stream auto-recovery** ([#100](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/100)):
	HealthCheck now routes dropped streams through the error/backoff
	path so the 10s reconnect ticker actually picks them up (was
	logging "reconnecting" without reconnecting). `connectCamera` also
	clears any prior go2rtc entry before re-registering so a stuck
	source pool gets fully torn down. Rename-in-Wyze-app orphans are
	reaped by MAC each discovery cycle instead of accumulating stale
	streams forever.
- **Grid audio stays muted** ([#112](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/112)):
	`<video-rtc>` now honors a `muted` attribute proactively, so the
	grid stays quiet even after the browser grants autoplay
	permission from a single-camera click. Detail page is unchanged.
- **Camera-name doc** ([#99](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/99)):
	Expanded MIGRATION.md → "Changed: Camera names" with the specific
	Frigate / HA `camera:` / Lovelace / Node-RED surfaces to update.
- **HL_CAM4 (V4) auto-hint** ([#117](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/117),
	[#92](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/92),
	[#87](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/87)):
	Wyze's early-2025 firmware disabled TUTK on newer V4 units. The
	issues registry now emits a targeted hint when it sees chronic
	TUTK timeouts on an `HL_CAM4` — the fix is a one-line override
	(`MODEL_OVERRIDES=HL_CAM4:is_webrtc=true`) documented in README +
	MIGRATION.md → "Known Issues". Runtime auto-fallback is designed
	for 4.5.

## 4.4.1

Hotfix for [#119](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/119):
OG cameras (`GW_GC1` / `GW_GC2`) worked on 4.3.0 but broke on 4.4.0
for many users. Field reports confirm Wyze's mars-webcsrv WebRTC
backend serves OG hardware reliably, so the default has flipped to
WebRTC. Users on 4.4.0 already applying the `is_webrtc=true` override
can drop it.

- **OG default is now WebRTC** (`GW_GC1`, `GW_GC2`) — no more
	gwell-proxy sidecar spawn for OG-only fleets.

## 4.4.0

Code-review pass + community PRs: hardening, parity, observability,
new camera models, and tests across the bridge.

### Camera support

- **AN_RDB1 (Doorbell Pro 2)** routed to the WebRTC path (was silently
	falling through to TUTK).
- **GW_DUO (Cam Pan Duo)** routed to the WebRTC path (mars-webcsrv
	signaling, same backend as the Doorbell Pro) with `is_pan` set.
- **GW_WC (Window Cam)** routed to Gwell P2P (LAN-direct, same path
	as OG cameras). Needs a manual LAN IP — see new HA UI below.
- **LD_CFP (Floodlight Pro)** routed to WebRTC via AWS KVS.
- **OG cameras (GW_GC1 / GC2)** now correctly classify as Gwell P2P
	even when the Wyze cloud reports an empty LAN IP.
- New `IsGwellP2P` registry flag distinguishes LAN-direct Gwell models
	(OG, Window Cam) from doorbell-lineage Gwell (Doorbell Pro / Duo).

### HA add-on UI

- **Manual LAN IPs** for Gwell cameras (under "Gwell Protocol
	Cameras → Manual LAN IPs"): list of `{mac, lan_ip}` entries that
	feed the new `GWELL_LAN_IPS` env var, applied at discovery time.
	Use this when the Wyze cloud doesn't report a LAN IP for `GW_DUO`
	or `GW_WC` and gwell-proxy can't lock LAN-direct.
- **Camera Model Registry overrides** (new section "Camera Model
	Registry → Model Overrides"): list of `{model, name, is_*}`
	entries that override or add rows in the bridge's model registry
	at startup via the new `MODEL_OVERRIDES` env var. Lets operators
	add a brand-new Wyze model code or flip routing flags on an
	existing one without rebuilding the bridge.

### Reliability

- **Pre-registered Gwell publish slots**: gwell-proxy's RTSP PUSH no
	longer races the runtime AddStream and gets dropped with a broken
	pipe; the slot is reserved in go2rtc's startup YAML.
- **gwell-proxy reconnect**: uses the cached P2P server endpoint on
	stream-error retries instead of re-running full discovery.
- **KVS signaling double-encode fix** (`FixKVSSignalingURL`): some
	Wyze cameras (observed on LD_CFP) return a SigV4-encoded URL with
	`%252F` instead of `%2F`; AWS KVS rejects with 403. Single-decode
	when the tell-tale `%25` is present.
- **WebRTC-streamer discovery branch**: `GetCameraList` skips the
	LAN-IP / P2P-ID checks for WebRTC-only models (LD_CFP doesn't
	report either) — MAC + Model is enough.
- Atomic state-file writes (write-to-temp + rename) under a write
	mutex; concurrent state-change goroutines no longer race the file.
- Wyze API auth-lifecycle observer wires failures + recoveries to the
	issues registry (`/metrics`, `/api/health`,
	`sensor.wyze_bridge_config_errors`).
- Chronic camera-error reporting: >10 consecutive failed connects on
	a camera posts a `camera/chronic/<name>` issue; cleared on next
	stream.
- MQTT publish backpressure: bounded waiter pool prevents goroutine
	leak when the broker is unreachable; loud-then-rate-limited drop
	log.
- Graceful ffmpeg recorder shutdown (SIGINT + `WaitDelay`) — last mp4
	segment finalizes cleanly instead of being SIGKILL-truncated.

### Architecture / quality

- Single `ModelSpec` registry replaces five hardcoded maps; adding a
	new camera is one row (or one Model Override entry above).
- `webui.NewServer` takes an `Options` struct (drops several Set*
	setters); `mqtt.NewClient` is ctx-first.
- `cmd/wyze-bridge/main.go`'s `wireCameraStateChanges` split into
	per-subsystem helpers.
- `issues.Registry` methods nil-safe (callers no longer guard).
- Typed `wyzeapi.GetCameraKVSConfig` replaces raw-map parsing.
- `/api/*` errors return JSON `{"error":"…"}` via `writeJSONError`.
- `mqtt.Client` + `webui.Server` propagate the bridge's signal-
	cancellable root context to fire-and-forget handler goroutines.
- Doorbell labels aligned with Wyze marketing names ("Wyze Video
	Doorbell Pro" / "Pro 2" / "Duo").
- `DOCS/GW_BE1_Research.md` captures pcap-based protocol notes.

### Observability & UX

- README "Issues registry" subsection explaining `config_errors`,
	active categories, and the three surfaces that show them.
- Actionable hints for known Wyze API response codes (1001 bad creds,
	1003 bad API key, 2001 token expired, 3019 MFA, …).
- Network-error classifier distinguishes DNS / timeout / `OpError`
	from generic transport failures; HTTP 5xx / 429 / 401-403 render
	with actionable text.
- `/metrics` page: per-section legend captions + hover tooltips on
	every column header and summary tile.
- DEVELOPER.md "Adding a new camera model" section.

### New env vars

- `GWELL_LAN_IPS=MAC=IP,MAC=IP` — pin LAN IPs for Gwell cameras the
	Wyze cloud doesn't report. HA UI feeds this from Gwell → Manual
	LAN IPs.
- `MODEL_OVERRIDES=MODEL:flag=v,flag=v;MODEL:...` — override or add
	model registry rows at startup. HA UI feeds this from Camera
	Model Registry → Model Overrides. Flags: `name`, `is_gwell`,
	`is_gwell_p2p`, `is_webrtc`, `is_pan`, `is_doorbell`.

### Tests

- Webui smoke coverage (prometheus, dashboard, metrics page+JSON,
	route table, HLS / WS proxy).
- `mqtt.Client` (constructor defaults, callback registration,
	`publishSem` saturation).
- `/api/*` actions (audio toggle, quality validation, record
	start/stop, `/api/discover` no-hook / GET-405 / with-hook, health
	degraded mode, KVS shim happy + reject).
- Model registry (`IsGwellP2P`, `IsWebRTCStreamer` matrix,
	`ApplyModelOverrides` parser, `FixKVSSignalingURL`,
	`gwellLanIPOverride`).
- New camera-classification tests for GW_WC, LD_CFP, GW_DUO.

### Docs

- `.env.dev.example` aligned with current env-var names.
- `DOCS/DESIGN.md` MQTT topic table synced.
- `DEVELOPER.md` release flow + Adding-a-camera-model.

	P2P even when the Wyze cloud returns an empty LAN IP.
- PR #116 (wlatic): GW_DUO + `GWELL_LAN_IPS` env var +

	GW_DUO via WebRTC.

## 4.3.0

MQTT Phase 1 release focused on control parity improvements with the legacy bridge,
while documenting go2rtc-era control boundaries.

### Added

- MQTT stream control topics:
	- `{topic}/{cam}/state/set` (`start`/`stop`)
	- `{topic}/{cam}/power/set` (`on`/`off`/`restart`)
- MQTT power state publishing on `{topic}/{cam}/power`
- Cloud-backed MQTT property control mapping (write-only mirror):
	- `night_vision`, `irled`, `status_light`, `motion_detection`,
		`motion_tagging`, `bitrate`, `fps`, `hor_flip`, `ver_flip`
- Home Assistant discovery entities for Phase 1 controls:
	- stream switch, power switch, reboot button, snapshot button
	- IR/status light/motion detection/motion tagging switches
	- bitrate/fps number controls
	- horizontal/vertical flip switches
- MQTT capability and scope reference in `DOCS/MQTT_SPEC.md`

### Changed

- Night vision mapping aligned to cloud property semantics (`auto` => `3`)
- MQTT expectations now explicitly split into `Implemented`, `Phase 1`, and `Deferred`
	in the spec to clarify what requires direct TUTK control vs. cloud API fallback

### Notes

- Live camera property readback parity from the Python bridge remains deferred because
	go2rtc owns the active TUTK session and does not expose a Wyze property-control API.
- Pan/tilt K110xx command parity and full `{prop}/get` MQTT readback are out of scope
	for this phase.



## 4.2.2

Complete rewrite in Go. See [MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/IDisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/blob/main/MIGRATION.md) for upgrade instructions.

### Changed

- Docker image under 25 MB (was 200+ MB)
- WebUI completely redesigned (dark theme, grid layout, WebRTC player)
- State persistence via JSON (replaces pickle files)
- MQTT auto-detects Home Assistant Mosquitto broker

### Removed

- Python runtime and all Python dependencies
- Binary TUTK SDK (`.so` files)
